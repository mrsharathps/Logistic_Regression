DataSet: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income

Define potential problems that can be addressed using the machine learning techniques you have learnt.  Formulate the problem in terms of supervised learning with justifications and perform activities such as preparing the dataset for analysis; investigating the relationships in the data set with visualization; creating a model; evaluating the performance of the classification model.


Demonstrate ML Life cycle illustrating the following activities:
•	Problem statement
•	Exploratory data analysis –Any techniques such as PCA are needed
•	Preprocess the data
•	Algorithm selection aspects and composition of Training data, test data 
•	Train the model 
•	Test the model (Predictions and reporting)
•	Performance evaluation of the model
•	Suggest ways of improving the model
